# ISO-DART: Independent System Operator Data Automated Request Tool

### Introduction
Very early stages of a simple tool able to create multiple automated requests of different ISO data. 
Currently supporting:
* California Independent System Operator (CAISO).
* Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).
* New York Independent System Operator (NYISO).

## Authors
* Thomas Edmunds, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
* Amelia Musselman, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
* Pedro Sotorrio, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
* Chih-Che Sun, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

## System Requirements and Installation
These are very basic instructions so any type of user can get ISO-DART up and running in their machines. More advance 
users can skip the appropriate steps.

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com/).

Once Git and Anaconda are installed, in a terminal run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/LLNL/ISO-DART.git  # Clone ISO-DART GitHub repository
cd iso-dart  # Change to iso-dart directory
conda create --name iso-dart python=3.8  # Create iso-dart Anaconda environment
conda activate iso-dart  # Activate iso-dart environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install required packages
```

## Usage
The tool as of now is very rudimentary and it works as a simple command line script where the user answers
a few questions regarding the ISO, start date, duration, and type of data they desire to acquire. 

In the command line just run the following command: `python ISODART.py`
