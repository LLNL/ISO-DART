# ISO-DART: Independent System Operator Data Automated Request Tool

## Introduction
Very early stages of a simple tool able to create multiple automated requests of different ISO data. 
Currently supporting:
* California Independent System Operator (CAISO).
* Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).
* New York Independent System Operator (NYISO).

## Authors
* Thomas Edmunds, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
* Amelia Musselman, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
* Pedro Sotorrio, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
* Chih-Che Sun, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

## System Requirements and Installation
These are very basic instructions so any type of user can get ISO-DART up and running in their machines. More advance 
users can skip the appropriate steps.

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com/).

Once Git and Anaconda are installed, in a terminal run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/LLNL/ISO-DART.git  # Clone ISO-DART GitHub repository
cd iso-dart  # Change to iso-dart directory
conda create --name iso-dart python=3.8  # Create iso-dart Anaconda environment
conda activate iso-dart  # Activate iso-dart environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install required packages
```

## Usage
The tool as of now is very rudimentary, and it works as a simple command line script where the user answers
a few questions regarding the type of data (ISO or weather data), the specific ISO or weather station, start date, 
and end date for the desired dataset. 

In the command line just run the following command: `python ISODART.py`

## Weather Module
The weather module uses the [Meteostat](https://dev.meteostat.net/) python library. Although documentation can
be found online, below you can find a description of the columns you will get in your dataset:

| Column                 | Description                                  | Type       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| time                   | The datetime of the observation              | Datetime64 |
| temperature            | The air temperature in *ºF*                  | Float64    |
| dew_point              | The dew point in *ºF*                        | Float64    |
| relative_humidity      | The relative humidity in percent (*%*)       | Float64    |
| precipitation          | The one hour precipitation total in *inches* | Float64    |
| snow_depth             | The snow depth in *inches*                   | Float64    |
| wind_dir               | The average wind direction in degrees (*º*)  | Float64    |
| wind_speed             | The average wind speed in *mph*              | Float64    |
| wind_peak_gust         | The peak wind gust in *mph*                  | Float64    |
| air_pressure           | The average sea-level air pressure in *hPa*  | Float64    |
| sunshine               | The one hour sunshine total in *min*         | Float64    |
| weather_condition      | The weather condition description            | String     |


        NOTE: Keep in mind some of these columns will not show up in the final dataset because the program 
        will drop those columns where all values are null. 

### National Solar Radiation Database ([NSRDB](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/)) API
Within the weather module, the user has the opportunity to download solar data for the same location they downloaded 
weather data previously. 

The first the user decides to use this capability, they will be guided on how to get an API token and provide it to the 
program. ISO-DART will save that information in a configuration file, so the user doesn't have to go through the same 
process ever again.
